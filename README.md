Clade-specific patterns of scrambling​(Problem Statement and Description)
Bacteria show cross-like patterns of scrambling because they tend to preserve codirectionality between replication and transcription.
So,
   • Can we train an AI model to recognise this pattern:
                -despite circular permutations?
            and -regardless of the extent of scrambling?
   • Can we train an AI model to quantify the extent of scrambling, taking this pattern into consideration?
